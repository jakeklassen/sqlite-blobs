# Sqlite Images

I used `pnpm` but you can just use `npm` or `yarn` if you want.

`yarn start`

`db.db` is the database file.

Visit `http://localhost:3000/create` to add a new random image.
Visit `http://localhost:3000/assets/:id` to fetch a specific image.

`http://localhost:3000/assets/10` is a very large Earth image from `https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/618486main_earth_full.jpg`

Used `https://sqlitebrowser.org/` to browse the database.
